# IBM-Capstone-Project-SpaceX

## IBM Data Science Capstone Project - SpaceX

### Introduction

In this capstone project, it will be predicted if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX claims that Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if it  can be determined that if the first stage will land, then it can be determined the cost of a launch. This information is very useful for a competing company which wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

This capstone project course will go through in real life and working with real datasets. It assumes the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX, and in the process follow the Data Science methodology involving data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting your results to stakeholders. The objective is predicting if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully.

### Business Problem
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its site, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if it can be accurately predicted the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, it can be determined the cost of a launch. With the help of  Data Science findings and models, the competing startup can make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

### Objective
* To apply data science toolkit and machine learning in order to accurately predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, and thus determine the cost of a launch.
Explore the data in order to obtain more insight from the data.

### Business metric
Classification accuracy - number of correct prediction divided by the total number of prediction defined as:
 

### Confusion matrix

### Deliverables
* Accurate predictive algorithms
* Business case report to stakeholders
